## Project Idea

### UN Sustainable development goal number: 4 (education) & 10 (reduced inequalities)

### Motivation: To help as many students get a better quality of education

### Features:
- Students, organizations, and individuals can create an account
- Students can enter required personal information & select which electronics they need
- Organizations and individuals can list technological items for donation
- A queue system to allow a fair wait time for laptops on a first come first serve basis
- Students are informed per email once a device has been offered to them
- A person can only apply once and the app will tell us if they received their device or not


## Technologies

1. Back-end: Spring
2. Front-end: ReactJS
3. Database: MongoDB
4. Testing: Junit, Manual, Postman

## Deployment
- Create a MongoDB deployment, local or in the cloud
- Install a Java JDK with Maven support and NodeJS
- Build and run the back-end, which will create a file at `~/.techdon/pref.json`
- Fill in valid MongoDB and SMTP Server credentials
- Start the server again, which should now succeed
- Go to the `front-end` folder in a terminal and run `npm install`
- You can now run `npm start`, which should launch the front-end on `localhost:3000`
- If you chose to deloy the instance, route port 3000 to 8000 and attach an A record to your domain's DNS
